<p>Ms Maryam Mahomed, third-year Medical student, has been appointed as the President of the South African Medical Students Association (SAMSA), nationally.</p>
<p>SAMSA is a body for Medical students from across the country aimed at making a difference in communities through professional medical development and community outreach initiatives.</p>
<p>Mahomed, who joined SAMSA in 2020 upon starting her Medical degree, said she was inspired to be part of this initiative by its members who encompassed the ‘principles of ardour and benevolence’ which she values.</p>
<p>Having previously occupied the positions of Regional President and National Vice-Chair, she highlighted some of the projects SAMSA has been involved in, including establishing a South African Bone Marrow Donor Station at UKZN’s Medical School; holding professional development workshops titled: Business and Medicine: A Duality Workshop and The Process of Specialisation in South Africa; being part of the Comrades Marathon Medical Response Team; fundraising for the Shavathon Cancer Campaign; and conducting a health screening day at the Masihambisane Clinic in Cato Manor, Durban.</p>
<p>As the national President, she plans to facilitate the collection of rape “comfort handbags” filled with hygienic and sanitary products necessary for victims of sexual assault as part of the Jes Foord Foundation; expand the South African Bone Marrow Donor Stations in university campuses and mobile screening programmes nationally; establish a sustainable blood donor programme with the South African National Blood Services; create a structured peer education tutor programme on campus; and bring about social networking events such as academic liaison, research networking and interprofessional development.</p>
<p>Mahomed said she was honoured and humbled to be elected to this role, thanking the SAMSA 2022 executive team as well as her family for their support. ‘It’s not every day that we are afforded the privilege of addressing the grievances within our systems. For me, national presidency is an opportunity to not only serve our communities, but to also serve my peers who have entrusted me with such a role. I hope that through this position, I can serve with an attitude of student leadership and help carve avenues through which my colleagues can practice the same virtues.’</p>
<p>Her mother, Mrs Sultana Mahomed, a special needs educator and father, Mr Swaleh Mahomed, an attorney, both agreed that the role of national President was made for her.</p>
<p>Said Sultana: ‘Maryam has always put the interest of others first, serving for the betterment and wellbeing of our community,’ while Swaleh remarked: ‘Maryam has all the hallmarks of a humble, sincere and dedicated individual that will do the role justice.’</p>

<p>It is not every day that the world’s leading physicists come to Durban, but such was the case recently when UKZN hosted the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) leg of the 183<sup>rd</sup> Nobel Symposium in Physics Public Outreach programme.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Nobel Foundation, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study, it was the first time that this prestigious Nobel Symposium has come to Africa.</p>
<p>Two township schools in Durban, Phembisizwe High School in Ntuzuma and Mayville Secondary School benefitted from in-person visits from Professors Erik Aurell (Sweden), Mogens Hogh Jensen (Denmark), Armita Nourmohammad (USA), Luca Gammaitoni (Italy) and Angelo Vulpiani (Italy).</p>
<p>The professors spoke of their personal journeys as scientists and their areas of expertise.</p>
<p>On hand to welcome Aurell and Gammaitoni to Phembisizwe High School was Mr Kwanele Mthembu who introduced his guests to the 40 Grade 10 and 11 learners who were eagerly awaiting their arrival. While Gammaitonni shared the secrets of physics and the universe using a capful of Durban beach sand to illustrate his message, Aurell tackled the elusive nature of quantum physics. Learners were kept on their toes but responded with ‘interesting and challenging questions,’ said Aurell. The session concluded with a lively science show given by STEC@UKZN Science Centre interns, Mr Samkele Njiva and Mr Thembelani Khumalo.</p>
<p>At Mayville Secondary school, Jensen, Vulpiani and Nourmohammad shared their own experiences as physicists in the world of Science. UKZN’s famous “Dr T” (Dr Tanja Reinhardt, Co-ordinator of UKZN’s Science Centre), pulled out all the stops for her Science Show, exciting both the learners and the visiting researchers! This visit was conducted in partnership with the Umkhumbane Schools project represented by Ms Precious Ngcobo and Mr Siphila Mtshali.</p>
<p>‘This was such a wonderful event that was fun, informative, and inspiring for our learners,’ said Umkhumbane Schools project Director, Ms Martha Bishai. ‘Thank you for making this opportunity for learning and exposure possible.</p>
<p>‘It was truly an awesome experience for myself and my team at UKZN,’ said Reinhardt. ‘Having the opportunity to meet and talk to world class scientists will hopefully inspire these learners to study for a career in Science once they finish school.’</p>
<p>‘This visit was illuminating in all kinds of respects,’ said Gammaitoni. ‘It was a real pleasure to share our knowledge and interact with these learners, whose circumstances mean that studying is often a luxury.’</p>

<p>Two students from the School of Education, Ms Phakamile Mazibuko and Mr Andile Gumede, were recently awarded the 2022 UKZN Student Spotlight Award which recognises academically excelling students who also actively participated in University and community outreach programmes during the online learning period.</p>
<p>The award was presented during the second UKZN Teaching and Learning Office’s (UTLO) virtual e-learning symposium titled: Imagining a Technology Enhanced Higher Education Future.</p>
<p>Symposium Chair, Mr Abdulbaqi Badru said as part of UTLO’s objectives to ensure that students are carried along in the University e-learning community of practice, they conceptualised the Spotlight Student Award.</p>
<p>He said students were required to submit a portfolio of evidence, which went through rigorous reviews to finally select the two winning students.</p>
<p>Mazibuko, a Master of Education student, said the transition from traditional to online learning was challenging at first because of the unfamiliarity which caused much anxiety and fear. She said she was grateful for the support services initiated by the University through workshops and webinars.</p>
<p>Through her non-profit organisation the Phakamile Mazibuko Foundation she was also able to offer career support through online workshops and social media.</p>
<p>Gumede, a final year Bachelor of Education student, who is also an academic monitoring and support mentor and member of Enactus UKZN, said the challenges brought on by online learning motivated him to lead by example.</p>
<p>He said besides the academic challenges, he also faced a lot of losses in his family. ‘Being able to help and receive help from my peers has been one of the top ingredients in achieving my success.’</p>
<p>He thanked UTLO and the symposium committee members for their support. Advising other students, he said: ‘Know that your dreams are valid and that on your path, you are never denied but redirected.’</p>
<p>The students were awarded a laptop and gift bags to aid them in their online learning.</p>

<p>School of Law Senior lecturer, Ms Suhayfa Bhamjee’s excellent ability of effectively explaining her PhD research in three minutes, earned her second place at the national Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition.</p>
<p>The competition was hosted by the University of Free State and saw 18 PhD participants &#8211; varying across the different disciplines &#8211; from nine South African universities compete for top honours. These competitors were selected following heats at the regional rounds of the competition hosted by their respective universities.</p>
<p>Titled: Murder or Mercy? End-of-Life Decision Making and a Patient’s Right to Choose Euthanasia, Bhamjee’s presentation was based on her PhD thesis: Death and Dying in aConstitutional Democracy &#8211; An Analysis of the Criminal Law and a Call for Law Reform, which won her the UKZN Three-Minute Thesis Competition and also received the People’s Choice Award. At this leg of the competition, Mr Sylvester Mukono placed second at the UKZN heat. He also represented UKZN at the national competition. His presentation was titled: Scourging Slime and was based on his thesis: Biofilm Control in Water Supply Pipeline Systems.</p>
<p>Speaking on her achievement, Bhamjee said summarising her research and explaining a complicated legal concept in layman’s terms was no easy feat, but is glad to have risen to the challenge.</p>
<p>‘The competition made me think about how I communicate and transmit ideas to an audience that is wider than the legal fraternity. Lawyers are prone to being long-winded and verbose, so it felt quite against the rules of nature to sum up an entire PhD thesis in just three minutes. To fight every instinct to say <em>dolus </em>and<em> volenti</em> made me feel like a Jedi without a lightsaber!’ she said.</p>
<p>Bhamjee revealed that her research findings include a parliament-ready piece of legislation which is expected to be presented to the relevant minister for consideration in due course.</p>
<p>‘My thesis makes an argument for the decriminalisation of voluntary active euthanasia (VAE). I do this by looking at the doctrinal principles which are the foundations of criminal law and consider these principles in the light of medical professional ethics, patients’ rights and the Constitution. Murder is the “unlawful, intentional causing of death of another person”,’ explained Bhamjee.</p>
<p>She added that the Law makes no liability distinction based on whether an accused person is a doctor, or whether the “victim” is a patient who has asked a doctor to help them die.</p>
<p>‘Assessing intention and causation in euthanasia scenarios proved that euthanasia intends to and does cause death. However, a further issue is unlawfulness. Contextually, an argument is that the patient voluntarily requested euthanasia, and so the doctor’s role ought to be excusable because the patient consented. The law is clear: consent is never a defence to murder. Fearing prosecution and punishment, doctors refuse to help.’</p>
<p>Bhamjee argues for the decriminalisation of VAE by focussing on consent, autonomy and dignity per medical practice, the law and the Constitution.</p>
<p>‘As it stands, VAE is murder, but it does not have to be. I confirmed that doctors must and do routinely assess patient-competence, and proved that the same can be done when a patient requests VAE. Shortened life expectancy does not mean lack of competence &#8211; except of course when VAE is discussed. “Do no harm” also means “do not force patients to suffer”. I recommend law reforms by providing a complete piece of legislation, ready for parliamentary approval. The Medically Assisted Death with Dignity Bill sets the parameters for regulated VAE, allowing patients the freedom to choose and doctors the freedom to help. It is my great hope that the law reforms I recommend will assist in making realisable the wishes of patients who seek a dignified death with medical assistance,’ she said.</p>
<p>The 3MT competition is an annual event, and UKZN will once again begin its preparations for the 2023 National Competition.</p>
<p>Bhamjee is encouraging those who qualify to enter. ‘I encourage all PhD candidates to pick up the mantle and give it a go. The 3MT was one of the most challenging, yet liberating and affirming experiences I have ever encountered on this PhD journey. Aside from personal growth, the support and encouragement from my friends, family and colleagues has been overwhelming. Not only for the 3MT, but throughout the duration of my PhD journey. I am so humbled by it all. UKZN really is a place that allows you to find your voice and grow as an academic,’ she said.</p>

<p>Six Masters in Social Science Research Psychology students and their lecturer Professor Mary van der Riet visited the Human Sciences Research Council’s (HSRC) Centre for Community Based Research (CCBR) in Sweetwaters outside Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p>The students Mr Nqobani Zuma, Ms Mbali Phakathi, Ms Banele Ndebele, Ms Emelda Tselana, Mr Tim Hardwick and Ms Nikita Chetty were hosted by Dr Hilton Humphries of the HSRC. They were introduced to the HSRC’s research and were accompanied by the CCBR’s community team to visit several projects currently underway in the community surrounding the site. This was a good introduction to conducting applied social science research.</p>
<p>Said van der Riet, ‘The visit developed out of the strong relationship between the Discipline of Psychology (School of Applied Human Sciences) in Pietermaritzburg and the HSRC. Many UKZN alumni have been employed as researchers and even executive members of the HSRC. The Masters Social Science in Research Psychology programme aims to develop professional researchers with a broad range of skills who can design, co-ordinate and manage programmes and interventions. Seeing how the HSRC conducts social and health-related research, exposes students to social science research in action, and develops their professional identity and aspirations.’</p>
<p>Hardwick said he ‘enjoyed getting to see what a research site looks like first hand, as well as interacting with the people who work there who were all really warm and welcoming.’</p>
<p>For Chetty, ‘the opportunity to observe research projects being carried out on a much larger scale was interesting. It was interesting to learn about the different environments in which research work is carried out. It’s not an office and a laptop, but involves being physically active and building relationships with different individuals.’</p>
<p>Tselana added that, ‘learning about the different aspects of research, especially on a larger scale was an eye-opener. I found the various ongoing projects conducted by the HSRC interesting. The lengths the researchers go to collect data and maintain relationships with participants were insightful. I gained more knowledge about the HSRC and the daily life of a researcher which I found helpful as I am nearing the end of the coursework part of my master’s.’</p>

<p>Senior lecturer in the School of Chemistry and Physics Dr Vino Paideya was assigned the role of South African Coordinator by the South African National Resource Centre (SANRC), University of Johannesburg for the National Survey of Peer Leaders which forms part of the broader International Survey of Peer Leaders (ISPL). The national survey is designed to gain a cross-national perspective of how peer leadership experiences are structured and such leadership’s impact on academic performance.</p>
<p>The ISPL is co-ordinated by Professor Dallin Young as the principal investigator from the University of Georgia in the United States (US). The SANRC is co-ordinating the national survey for South Africa. The ISPL is a multi-country survey with countries such as the US, United Kingdom, Australia, Turkey, The Netherlands etc, participating. The SANRC office serves as the resource centre for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition and works closely with the “sister” organisation, the University of South Carolina in the US.</p>
<p>Paideya has worked in collaboration with Dr Annsilla Nyar on the ISPL Survey and the SANRC Office since 2017. She also served as the UKZN co-ordinator for the 2014-2015 ISPL that aimed to create an initial national snapshot of the development and experiences of peer leaders in South Africa and abroad.</p>
<p>The 2022 study, that commenced in January this year, is a more in-depth one. Paideya is contributing to contextualising the South African survey, recruiting academic support participants from the various Higher Education Institutions in the country and supporting each of the institutions in their applications for ethical clearance to participate in the survey.</p>
<p>She described the journey of working with the SANRC Office and international colleagues as an exciting one and looks forward to disseminating the UKZN and cross-national results with other participating institutions in 2023.</p>

<p>UKZN alumnus, multi-award-winning youth leader, One Young World ambassador, medical doctor, and activist, Dr Kapil Narain was selected to publish an editorial in the official journal of the World Health Organization (WHO), <em>The Bulletin</em>. The journal is ranked 7<sup>th</sup> out of 193 journals in the field of public, occupational and environmental health and is amongst the top 2.4% of journals internationally.</p>
<p>The editorial, Strategies for malaria vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic in African countries, focuses on the mechanisms governments and stakeholders can adopt to ensure the successful rollout of the malaria vaccine amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.</p>
<p>Since 2021, the WHO has recommended the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) malaria vaccine for children in areas of moderate to high transmission. Effective roll-out in Africa can only be achieved if region-specific challenges are overcome. The pandemic exposed stark healthcare inequalities on the continent, with malaria prevention and treatment amongst the health services that were disrupted as COVID-19 took priority.</p>
<p>Narain notes that health systems will need to formulate a short-term action plan for timely malaria vaccine delivery, based on the disease burden. Local social support organisations should be brought on board to achieve this goal. Regular surveillance of the malaria response is also required.</p>
<p>‘I initially submitted this as a perspective, but the academic board elevated it to an editorial. It was an absolute honour as an editorial in an academic journal is usually by invitation, and is written by professors or experts in a field,’ he said.</p>
<p>Amongst his many achievements, Narain has served as a member of the African Youth Front and is the former Chair of the COVID-19 Technical Working Group at the Federation of African Medical Students’ Association.</p>
<p>In 2020, he was named one of the <em>Mail &amp; Guardian</em>’s Top 200 Young South Africans and was the youngest in the Health Category.</p>
<p>His activism not only includes leading initiatives to tackle the stigma surrounding TB, HIV and mental health but also supporting the struggle for gender equality and raising awareness of the challenges confronting frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>He serves on the advisory board for the African Forum for Primary Health Care (AfroPHC) and is the Deputy Chair of the Active Citizens Movement and Chair of the Africa Healthcare Students Summit.</p>

<p>The participants in the Luthuli Museum/UKZN Schools Moot Court Competition impressed the judges with their excellent advocacy skills.</p>
<p>Hosted by UKZN’s School of Law in partnership with the Luthuli Museum, the annual competition offered Grade 11 pupils an opportunity to be equipped to argue a constitutional matter, in the KwaDukuza Magistrate’s Court.</p>
<p>This community outreach initiative aims to create greater awareness among schools and communities about the justice system, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, to prepare learners from Groutville and Stanger to participate in the Department of Basic Education’s Schools’ Moot competition, and to encourage gifted young learners to consider pursuing a career in Law.</p>
<p>The finalists were Grade 11 Fairbreeze Secondary School students, Ms Thusi Poullinate who represented the respondent and won the competition and Ms Lusanda Ngisu who represented the appellant. They argued a hypothetical case in which a 17-year-old pregnant learner challenged school policy on violation of her rights before judges Mr Rakesh Maharaj (Attorney at Rakesh Maharaj &amp; Co.), Control Prosecutor Mr Masithembe Fanaphi and Magistrate of the Court, Ms Rose Sepang.</p>
<p>Sepang enthused: ‘They performed better than some prosecutors. They are still in Grade 11, but were brave enough to challenge us.’</p>
<p>Maharaj commented: ‘Both finalists spoke exceptionally well and impressed us with their knowledge.’</p>
<p>‘They made clear points and we were able to engage with them,’ said Fanaphi. ‘This kind of setting can be intimidating but they were well prepared.’</p>
<p>Academic in the School of Law Dr Janine Hicks congratulated the participants and acknowledged Street Law students who dedicated 25 hours to conduct training sessions on legal content and court procedures in preparing a team of eight learners to participate in this year’s programme.</p>
<p>‘UKZN has a proud relationship and partnership with the Luthuli Museum, to honour the legacy of Inkosi Albert Luthuli. This programme enables our final-year Street Law students to connect with a passion for social justice issues and provides them with a life-changing opportunity. The Dean of the School of Law has provided a bursary of R20 000 for the winning student, should she opt to study Law at UKZN.’</p>
<p>One of the final-year LLB students who co-ordinated training, Ms Shria Naidu, said ‘The programme has been an enriching learning experience for us too. We hope that we have inspired a lasting passion for legal studies in them.’</p>
<p>Luthuli Museum Public Relations Officer, Ms Zinhle Nyembe, said the annual collaboration with the School of Law works well. She added that the University’s Law clinic continues to play an important role in providing the youth with legal education and motivating them to pursue a legal career.</p>
<p>‘Our Moot Court competition started in 2014 in partnership with UKZN, but for the past three years we were only able to work with one school because of COVID-19. Next year we aim to train more schools for this competition,’ she said.</p>

<p>Honours student in Drama and Performing Arts Mr Kwanele Nyembe was named the 2022 National Poetry Slam Champion during UKZN’s Poetry Africa Festival.</p>
<p>Nyembe, who won a cumulative prize of R22 000, will represent South Africa at the World Slam Poetry Competition in Brazil next year.</p>
<p>Also known as Tory Saint, Nyembe is a Durban-based poet, writer, actor and dancer.</p>
<p>‘There is a lot more work to be done. But today, we celebrate an evening spent with the best poets the nation has to offer,’ he said at the announcement. ‘Gratitude to the Centre for Creative Arts (CCA) and UKZN for providing this platform for artists. South Africa has the best poets in the world, and I am grateful to Poetry Africa for reflecting on this established belief. I look forward to retaining the title next year in Brazil.’</p>
<p>CCA Director Dr Ismail Mahomed said: ‘Congratulations to Kwanele. The 2022 Poetry Africa was an incredible success, affirming its position as a most relevant platform that brings poets together from across the world to share, critique and celebrate each other’s creativity. At the same time, the festival is a barometer of how poets read and interpret our social, political and global conditions. Poetry Africa is a dynamic advocate for social justice.’</p>
<p>A jury member for Slam Jam and Head of World Poetry Slam, Dr Philip Meersman of Belgium, added: ‘The use of Kwanele’s voice, the deliberate delivery in (not) using the microphone, the audience interaction, restrained emotions, biblical references together with decorticating the human body into its essence with texts that were harsh as well as blaming and bringing people together, resulted in a well-deserved win.</p>
<p>&#8216;Kwanele is a true winner in every sense of the word, capturing and captivating his audience. He is a kind of magic that must be experienced live by the world.’</p>
<p>Nyembe is the co-founder of the Sink or Swim Podcast, a platform that serves as a media outlet for Durban-based performing artists to talk about their work and introduce the world to the people involved. As a performer he has worked with the Embassy of Sweden in Pretoria together with Hear my Voice, which curated a virtual series that incorporated creatives from different art sectors, including fashion, literature, music, the spoken word, media, government and academia, for co-learning and adapting to change and support during the peak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>He also performed at the Playhouse Sundowners Poetry and Jazz Show. Beyond this he has shared his work on various platforms such as Word N Sound and Worlds of Words.</p>
<p>He was a winner of UKZN’s Golden Key Poetry competition.</p>

<p>Information Systems and Technology Honours student Ms Nitasha Pillay was awarded the Aspiring Teen Award at the fifth annual Women in Tech Global Awards ceremony that took place in Dubai under the Patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Marwan Al Maktoum.</p>
<p>The event was organised by Women in Tech, a global non-profit organisation committed to bridging the gender gap and establishing a strong network of women in tech worldwide.</p>
<p>Eight winners from around the world were rewarded for their remarkable contributions to the tech industry.</p>
<p>The Aspiring Teen Award &#8211; judged by an international jury of Tech experts &#8211; is for an individual whose efforts and actions in technology indicate they have a clear path to a successful future.</p>
<p>Pillay was first a winner in the Women in Tech Africa Awards in Cape Town, going on to receive the global award in Dubai.</p>
<p>‘It was an honour to be awarded the Global Aspiring Teen Award by Her Highness, Sheikha Mozah bint Marwan Al Maktoum, who is the first Lieutenant Pilot at Dubai Police Airwing and an inspiration to women around the world. Your gift will make room for you and bring you before great people, always have faith in yourself,’ said Pillay.</p>
<p>She says she aims to use the experiences and knowledge gained through the Women in Tech Global Awards to make an impact in South Africa within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) space.</p>
<p>‘Unemployment and lack of technical skills are major concerns in South Africa. The work we do at the Tech Society UKZN is to empower young people in areas of leadership, STEM and available opportunities. I believe that the heart of true leadership is to serve others and to pick up your fellow brother and sister when they are falling because we rise by lifting others.’</p>
<p>Pillay, who graduated from UKZN with a Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing and Information Systems and Technology degree earlier this year, was appointed as a Women in Tech South Africa Youth Ambassador during the final year of her undergraduate studies and co-founded the Tech Society UKZN, a new student society aimed at empowering and mentoring students in the field of technology.</p>
<p>She serves as a Social Media and Marketing Community Manager at Women in Tech South Africa, was a project manager of Enactus UKZN, and represented UKZN in the Innovate Durban’s 2021 Youth Innovation Challenge where her team prototyped their own technology aimed at minimising child trafficking, securing them second place and earning her a Zutari Woman in Design award.</p>
<p>She was also the professional development director for the UKZN’s Golden Key Society on the Westville campus.</p>
<p>Speaking about her trip to Dubai, Pillay says sourcing funding was a challenge. She thanked her family, the Harmony Centre Church, Youth in Harmony, Terence Pillay, Nathan Pillay, JB Travel, Kholeka Tsotsotso and Take Note IT for making her visit possible.</p>
<p>‘I am here because someone believed in me. My mum, Pam Pillay, sourced a loan to ensure that this young South African Indian girl that has never seen the world, gets to be part of the Global Awards so I was grateful to have had my mum experience the journey with me. It is important to support the dreams of our youth and believe in their potential, you never know what the future holds for them.’</p>
