These competitors were selected following heats at the regional rounds of the competition hosted by their respective universities.<\/p>\n<p>Titled:\u00a0Murder or Mercy? End-of-Life Decision Making and a Patient\u2019s Right to Choose Euthanasia, Bhamjee\u2019s presentation was based on her PhD thesis:\u00a0Death and Dying in aConstitutional Democracy &#8211; An Analysis of the Criminal Law and a Call for Law Reform, which won her the UKZN Three-Minute Thesis Competition and also received the People\u2019s Choice Award. At this leg of the competition, Mr Sylvester Mukono placed second at the UKZN heat. He also represented UKZN at the national competition. His presentation was titled:\u00a0Scourging Slime\u00a0and was based on his thesis: Biofilm Control in Water Supply Pipeline Systems.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking on her achievement, Bhamjee said summarising her research and explaining a complicated legal concept in layman\u2019s terms was no easy feat, but is glad to have risen to the challenge.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018The competition made me think about how I communicate and transmit ideas to an audience that is wider than the legal fraternity. Lawyers are prone to being long-winded and verbose, so it felt quite against the rules of nature to sum up an entire PhD thesis in just three minutes. To fight every instinct to say\u00a0<em>dolus\u00a0<\/em>and<em>\u00a0volenti<\/em>\u00a0made me feel like a Jedi without a lightsaber!\u2019 she said.<\/p>\n<p>Bhamjee revealed that her research findings include a parliament-ready piece of legislation which is expected to be presented to the relevant minister for consideration in due course.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018My thesis makes an argument for the decriminalisation of voluntary active euthanasia (VAE). I do this by looking at the doctrinal principles which are the foundations of criminal law and consider these principles in the light of medical professional ethics, patients\u2019 rights and the Constitution.\u00a0Murder is the \u201cunlawful, intentional causing of death of another person\u201d,\u2019 explained Bhamjee.<\/p>\n<p>She added that the Law makes no liability distinction based on whether an accused person is a doctor, or whether the \u201cvictim\u201d is a patient who has asked a doctor to help them die.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Assessing intention and causation in euthanasia scenarios proved that euthanasia intends to and does cause death. However, a further issue is unlawfulness. Contextually, an argument is that the patient voluntarily requested euthanasia, and so the doctor\u2019s role ought to be excusable because the patient consented. The law is clear: consent is never a defence to murder. Fearing prosecution and punishment, doctors refuse to help.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Bhamjee argues for the decriminalisation of VAE by focussing on consent, autonomy and dignity per medical practice, the law and the Constitution.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018As it stands, VAE is murder, but it does not have to be. I confirmed that doctors\u00a0must\u00a0and do\u00a0routinely assess patient-competence, and proved that the same can be done when a patient requests VAE. Shortened life expectancy does not mean lack of competence &#8211; except of course when VAE is discussed. \u201cDo no harm\u201d also means \u201cdo not force patients to suffer\u201d. I recommend law reforms by providing a complete piece of legislation, ready for parliamentary approval. The Medically Assisted Death with Dignity Bill sets the parameters for regulated VAE, allowing patients the freedom to choose and doctors the freedom to help. It is my great hope that the law reforms I recommend will assist in making realisable the wishes of patients who seek a dignified death with medical assistance,\u2019 she said.<\/p>\n<p>The 3MT competition is an annual event, and UKZN will once again begin its preparations for the 2023 National Competition.<\/p>\n<p>Bhamjee is encouraging those who qualify to enter. \u2018I encourage all PhD candidates to pick up the mantle and give it a go. The 3MT was one of the most challenging, yet liberating and affirming experiences I have ever encountered on this PhD journey. Aside from personal growth, the support and encouragement from my friends, family and colleagues has been overwhelming. Not only for the 3MT, but throughout the duration of my PhD journey. I am so humbled by it all. UKZN really is a place that allows you to find your voice and grow as an academic,\u2019 she said.<\/p>\n<p>Words:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:Jumo@ukzn.ac.za\">Thandiwe Jumo<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Photograph: Supplied<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>School of Law Senior lecturer, Ms Suhayfa Bhamjee\u2019s excellent ability of effectively explaining her PhD research in three minutes, earned her second place at the national Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition.
