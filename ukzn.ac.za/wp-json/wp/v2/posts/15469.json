Violence is not the\nsolution to the challenges we are facing. This behavior is only making matters\nworse. University management genuinely cares for financially disadvantaged\nstudents and is making every effort to help clear historic debt to enable\naffected students to register.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Management is working on various fundraising initiatives and is\ncontinuously in talks with Student Leadership and other relevant stakeholders.\nThe closing date for registration has also been extended to the 6<sup>th<\/sup>\nof March 2020 to assist both students and management in this regard. We need\nall students to be patient and allow time and space for a resolution to this\nmatter. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 80 percent of the student population have registered to date.\nEvery effort is being made to ensure that students do not lose valuable\nteaching time and are also protected from any acts of violence and\nintimidation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safety and security of students and staff is of paramount\nimportance. University security staff, SAPS, and Public Order Policing have\nbeen working day and night to bolster safety and security efforts. It is not\nalways possible to cover every area of each campus and at all times, for this\nreason, we need students and staff to be careful of their surroundings. As far\nas possible, avoid areas of conflict and immediately contact the University RMS\noffice if you feel unsafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All incidents of assault, destruction of property, intimidation and\narson are being investigated. The perpetrators will be apprehended and handed\nover to SAPS for prosecution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rest assured, UKZN Management is doing everything possible to resolve\nthis matter, put a stop to the violence and intimidation, and ensure that there\nare no further interruptions to the Academic Programme.<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Issued by Corporate Relations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT<\/strong><br><br><strong>19 February 2020<\/strong> <br><br><strong>Westville Campus<\/strong>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>The University Academic Programme is continuing as\nscheduled on all campuses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning one of the three entrances to the\nWestville Campus was blocked but has since been cleared.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>South African Police Services and University security are currently monitoring the situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Issued by Corporate Relations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>15 February 2020<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>COMMUNIQU\u00c9 FROM THE OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR <\/strong><br><strong>ACADEMIC PROGRAMME RESUMES<\/strong><br><strong>ALL CAMPUSES, ALL COLLEGES<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To Staff and Students,<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decision has been taken to\nresume the academic programme as from 07h45 on Monday, 17 February 2020.&nbsp;\nLectures, practicals, seminars and tutorials will all resume on Monday as per\nspecific academic timetables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, registration for\nboth undergraduate and postgraduate students will continue, closing at 16H00 on\nFriday, 6 March 2020.&nbsp; I urge all students to conclude their registration\nas soon as possible to enable access to Moodle and other online resources only\navailable to registered students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussions between the EMC and\nthe SRC will continue in the interim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please continue to assist us by\ntaking care of your personal belongings, being aware of your surroundings at\nall times and reporting suspicious behaviour to Risk Management Services (RMS).\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<table class=\"wp-block-table\"><tbody><tr><td>\n  <strong>Campus<\/strong>\n  <\/td><td>\n  <strong>RMS Phone Numbers<\/strong>\n  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\n  Howard College\n  <\/td><td>\n  031 260 2540 \/ 2542\n  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\n  Edgewood\n  <\/td><td>\n  031 260 3462 \/ 3493\n  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\n  Westville\n  <\/td><td>\n  031 260 7133 \/ 7265\n  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\n  Pietermaritzburg\n  <\/td><td>\n  033 260 5211 \/ 5231\n  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\n  Medical School\n  <\/td><td>\n  031&nbsp; 260 4516\n  <\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your patience,\nand any inconvenience is regretted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours sincerely<br><strong>Dr K Cleland<\/strong><br><strong>Acting Registrar<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>12 February 2020<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>12 February 2020<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>COMMUNIQU\u00c9 FROM THE OFFICE OF THE VICE-CHANCELLOR<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ukzn.ac.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/A-CALL-FOR-PERSPECTIVE-ON-OUR-ISSUES-AND-A-REQUEST-FOR-CREATIVE-ENGAGEMENT-ON-THE-WAY-FORWARD.pdf\">A CALL FOR PERSPECTIVE ON OUR ISSUES AND A REQUEST FOR CREATIVE ENGAGEMENT ON THE WAY FORWARD<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9\nFebruary 2020<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>COMMUNIQU\u00c9 FROM THE\nOFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ONGOING SUSPENSION\nOF THE ACADEMIC PROGRAMME<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ALL CAMPUSES, ALL\nCOLLEGES<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To Staff and Students,<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A decision has been taken to\ncontinue the suspension of the academic programme, from 07h45 on Monday, 10\nFebruary 2020, until further notice.
