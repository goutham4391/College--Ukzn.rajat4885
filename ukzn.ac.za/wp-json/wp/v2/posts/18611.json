They argued a hypothetical case in which a 17-year-old pregnant learner challenged school policy on violation of her rights before judges Mr Rakesh Maharaj (Attorney at Rakesh Maharaj &amp; Co.),\u00a0Control Prosecutor Mr Masithembe Fanaphi and Magistrate of the Court, Ms Rose Sepang.<\/p>\n<p>Sepang enthused: \u2018They performed better than some prosecutors. They are still in Grade 11, but were brave enough to challenge us.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Maharaj commented: \u2018Both finalists spoke exceptionally well and impressed us with their knowledge.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u2018They made clear points and we were able to engage with them,\u2019 said Fanaphi. \u2018This kind of setting can be intimidating but they were well prepared.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Academic in the School of Law Dr Janine Hicks congratulated the participants and acknowledged Street Law students who dedicated 25 hours to conduct training sessions on legal content and court procedures in preparing a team of eight learners to participate in this year\u2019s programme.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018UKZN has a proud relationship and partnership with the Luthuli Museum, to honour the legacy of Inkosi Albert Luthuli. This programme enables our final-year Street Law students to connect with a passion for social justice issues and provides them with a life-changing opportunity. The Dean of the School of Law has provided a bursary of R20 000 for the winning student, should she opt to study Law at UKZN.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>One of the final-year LLB students who co-ordinated training, Ms Shria Naidu, said \u2018The programme has been an enriching learning experience for us too. We hope that we have inspired a lasting passion for legal studies in them.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Luthuli Museum Public Relations Officer, Ms Zinhle Nyembe, said the annual collaboration with the School of Law works well. She added that the University\u2019s Law clinic continues to play an important role in providing the youth with legal education and motivating them to pursue a legal career.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Our Moot Court competition started in 2014 in partnership with UKZN, but for the past three years we were only able to work with one school because of COVID-19. Next year we aim to train more schools for this competition,\u2019 she said.<\/p>\n<p>Words:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:CeleS16@ukzn.ac.za\">Samukelisiwe Cele<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Photograph: Supplied<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The participants in the Luthuli Museum\/UKZN Schools Moot Court Competition impressed the judges with their excellent advocacy skills.
