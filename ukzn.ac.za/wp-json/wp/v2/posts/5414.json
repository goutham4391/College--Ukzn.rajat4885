To contest the CSRC elections (held simultaneously with LSRC elections) student organisations must have been recognised on at least three campuses of the University. The operations of the SRC are guided by the SRC Constitution and the authority of its Constitution, subject to the provision of the Higher Education Act of 1997 (as amended), the Institutional Statute of the University, and all other relevant laws of the Republic of South Africa, as well as to the authority of the University Council: its Constitution being the supreme authority in relation to student governance and activities at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<\/p>\n<p>The SRC represents students in all University matters affecting them as individuals and as a body.
