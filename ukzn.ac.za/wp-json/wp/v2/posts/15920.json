Also, the production has not been \nconsistent over successive years.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for this was that little emphasis is placed on innovation \nand implementation of post-harvest technologies in the horticultural \nvalue chain, vital to stimulate the desired high harvest yields and \nreduce losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018The availability of affordable post-harvest technology is of the \nupmost importance to meet consistently high productivity, and to make \navailable high-quality fresh produce in markets. \u2018Advanced post-harvest \ntechnologies which utilise complex machines that consume high energy are\n expensive for stakeholders in sub-Saharan Africa. Affordable low-cost \ninnovative post-harvest technologies have been developed and are ready \nfor implementation as intermediate technology to solve produce losses \nand ease food security challenges the continent is facing,\u2019 he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workneh described several innovative and affordable coolers that have\n been developed, including a naturally ventilated, single-pad and \nmulti-pad evaporative cooler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Integrated post-harvest technologies combining environmentally \nfriendly disinfection treatment and evaporative cooling have proven \neffective in extending the shelf life of horticultural crops. When \ndeveloped, these integrated post-harvest technologies were found to be \neffective under hot, arid and semi-arid conditions.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workneh, who has more than 28 years of experience in \nmultidisciplinary research in the area of agricultural engineering and \npostharvest technology, has received the School of Engineering\u2019s \nResearch Excellence Award eight times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His research interests include heat and mass transfer; hybrid drying \ntechnology; food processing and preservation technologies; optimisation \nand modelling of food processes; postharvest technology and process \nengineering of fruit and vegetables; food quality and food safety \nengineering; engineered systems for food production; environmental \nmodification; and control for biological systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has published more than 110 scientific articles in peer-reviewed \ninternational and local journals in the multi-disciplinary research \nareas of agricultural processing, food science and postharvest \ntechnology, environmental control for biological commodities, and \nrenewable energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workneh has supervised 35 MSc and PhD students and four postdoctoral \nfellows, and has received a UKZN School of Engineering Best Lecturer \naward twice.
