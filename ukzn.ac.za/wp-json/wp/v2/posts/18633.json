While Gammaitonni shared the secrets of physics and the universe using a capful of Durban beach sand to illustrate his message, Aurell tackled the elusive nature of quantum physics. Learners were kept on their toes but responded with \u2018interesting and challenging questions,\u2019 said Aurell. The session concluded with a lively science show given by STEC@UKZN Science Centre interns, Mr Samkele Njiva and Mr Thembelani Khumalo.<\/p>\n<p>At Mayville Secondary school, Jensen, Vulpiani and Nourmohammad shared their own experiences as physicists in the world of Science. UKZN\u2019s famous \u201cDr T\u201d (Dr Tanja Reinhardt, Co-ordinator of UKZN\u2019s Science Centre), pulled out all the stops for her Science Show, exciting both the learners and the visiting researchers! This visit was conducted in partnership with the Umkhumbane Schools project represented by Ms Precious Ngcobo and Mr Siphila Mtshali.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018This was such a wonderful event that was fun, informative, and inspiring for our learners,\u2019\u00a0said Umkhumbane Schools project\u00a0Director,\u00a0Ms Martha Bishai. \u2018Thank you for making this opportunity for learning and exposure possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018It was truly an awesome experience for myself and my team at UKZN,\u2019 said Reinhardt. \u2018Having the opportunity to meet and talk to world class scientists will hopefully inspire these learners to study for a career in Science once they finish school.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u2018This visit was illuminating in all kinds of respects,\u2019 said Gammaitoni. \u2018It was a real pleasure to share our knowledge and interact with these learners, whose circumstances mean that studying is often a luxury.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Words:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:Frosts@ukzn.ac.za\">Sally Frost<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Photographs: Supplied<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is not every day that the world\u2019s leading physicists come to Durban, but such was the case recently when UKZN hosted the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) leg of the 183rd Nobel Symposium in Physics Public Outreach programme.
