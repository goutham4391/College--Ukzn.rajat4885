This year, it features 6 217 \nHighly Cited Researchers in various fields from nearly 60 nations and \nincludes 23 Nobel Laureates. The analysis includes 21 broad research \nfields (including the social sciences) and includes cross-field \nperformance, as some Highly Cited Researchers appear in more than one \nfield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to David Pendlebury, Senior Citation Analyst at the \nInstitute for Scientific Information, \u2018The Highly Cited Researchers list\n contributes to the identification of that small fraction of the \nresearcher population that contributes disproportionately to extending \nthe frontiers of knowledge. These researchers create gains for society, \ninnovation and knowledge that make the world healthier, richer, more \nsustainable and more secure.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States is home to the highest number of Highly Cited \nResearchers, followed by the United Kingdom and China. About 15 \nresearchers from Africa appear on the list, including one from UKZN. \nResearchers from the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch, and \nPretoria, and the&nbsp;National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) \nare some of the other South Africans featured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Words:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:Smita.Maharaj@caprisa.org\">Smita Maharaj<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photograph: Supplied<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Professor Salim Abdool Karim is on the 2019 list of the world\u2019s most Highly Cited Researchers published by the Web of Science\u2019s Clarivate Analytics.
