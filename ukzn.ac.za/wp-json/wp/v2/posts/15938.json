He presented under the symposium sub-theme of water, land, \nenergy and agriculture, while Mabhaudhi led two special sessions at the \nsymposium, one on the Decision Analytic Framework to explore the \nWater-Food-Energy nexus, and another on the GWP-SA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mugiyo outlined his research that aims to develop suitability maps to\n identify optimal land for the production of neglected and underutilised\n crop species (NUCS), which are generally suitable for drought-prone \nareas, making them ideal for marginalised production systems. Limited \ninformation is available on the use of suitability maps for production \nand Mugiyo aims to fill this gap. His research focuses on sorghum, \ncowpea, taro and amaranth crops, making use of Geographic Information \nSystems and Multi-Criteria Decision Making Analysis and the Analytic \nHierarchy Process to develop suitability maps. Among other factors, the \nstudy takes into consideration historical climatic indicators, soil and \nlandscape attributes, socio-economic indicators, and technical \nindicators. The research has demonstrated that South Africa\u2019s marginal \nlands are suitable for the selected NUCS assessed in his study.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mugiyo also presented this research as a poster at UKZN\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/pris.ukzn.ac.za\/\">Postgraduate Research and Innovation Symposium<\/a>&nbsp;in\n October, for which he received first prize in the PhD category. His \nwork forms part of an ongoing initiative by the Centre of Transformative\n Agriculture and Food Systems in the SAEES to promote the use of NUCS to\n enhance food and nutrition security in marginal communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Words and Photograph:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:cuenod@ukzn.ac.za\">Christine Cu\u00e9nod<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mr Hillary Mugiyo, a PhD candidate in the Discipline of Crop Science at UKZN, received first prize for his oral presentation at the 20th WaterNet\/Water Research Fund for Southern Africa (WARFSA)\/Global Water Partnership Southern Africa (GWP-SA) Symposium.
