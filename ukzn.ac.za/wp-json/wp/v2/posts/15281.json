It compels a greater appreciation for community as a source \nof knowledge and the need to make porous the boundaries between \nuniversity and communities to enable a university to become more \nengaged.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academic Leader for the Cluster of Music at UKZN Professor Chats \nDevroop, and UKZN alumnus in Music and Drama Ms Jamy-Lee Simons \nentertained guests with musical interludes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DTA holder Dr Ansurie Pillay served as programme director.
