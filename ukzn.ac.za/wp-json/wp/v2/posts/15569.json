One\nof those \u201cWonder Women\u201d is Ms Mbali Gwacela from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/saees.ukzn.ac.za\/\">School of Agricultural, Earth\nand Environmental Sciences.<\/a>&nbsp;Gwacela accidentally ended up in the\nsciences, but said this field turned out to be bursting with possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018It is only when you understand the whys and hows of\nthe world you live in, that you get to appreciate all that the earth has to\noffer,\u2019 she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwacela started out in the social sciences studying\nGeography, which is where some of her earliest memories of science coming to\nlife begin. She recalls a few significant field trips with her class during\nundergraduate studies; two to the Drakensberg in the freezing cold where every rock\nstructure, soil type, and stone in and outside of the riverbed was examined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Literally everything we learned in class was tried\nand tested in real life. We were having so much fun as we learned and made\nreference to Professor (Trevor) Hill and Professor (Heinz) Beckedahl\u2019s\nlectures,\u2019 she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second field trip to Mtunzini, KwaZulu-Natal north\ncoast &#8211; which included everything from getting neck-deep in mud to \u201csurfing\u201d\ndown sand dunes &#8211; involved learning about coastal swamps, waves and dunes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018The field trips demanded a lot of work, yet were\nextreme fun,\u2019 said Gwacela.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her academic career would lead her to explore food\nsecurity during her postgraduate studies. Despite initially being fearful of\nscience, Gwacela said that in the subject, she discovered a field she called\n\u201cmind-blowing\u201d with limitless opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018I accidentally found myself in science, and when I\nrealised where I was, it was too late to change,\u2019 she said. \u2018It was then that I\nrealised I could have done science, if only I was more aware and open-minded to\nthe subject in high school, especially Mathematics.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwacela, who is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bwiselement.com\/\">Black Women in Science<\/a>&nbsp;non-profit\norganisation that mentors, guides and promotes science among disadvantaged\nBlack African women, encourages other young women to embrace Mathematics and\nScience instead of being intimidated by these subjects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018These two subjects are inclusive of so many things in\nthe world that we live in,\u2019 she said. \u2018If you are not doing well, then you have\nto do more research through the internet and enquiry \u2013 use what is available to\nsimplify your understanding. I was scared of these subjects, and now I have found\nmyself within it, loving it and regretful of the opportunities missed in my\nhigh school life.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwacela acknowledged the urgent need for attention to\nand investment in science education in South Africa, particularly for\nmarginalised communities with little to no access to scientific resources to\nenhance understanding of scientific concepts, especially for children headed to\nuniversity. She also highlighted that even more support is needed for young\ngirls wanting to enter the sciences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that women bring their unique capacity\nfor feeling and caring to the sciences, enabling them to tackle problems from\ndifferent angles and adding gentler, inclusive aspects to the way science is\napproached and applied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This role is not without its challenges, however.\n\u2018Being a woman in my field is very challenging, and it forces me to be\nconfident, resilient and to always have to justify or make known gender\nrelations,\u2019 she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Female researchers in her field also face challenges\nof acceptance in the communities they work with, often finding greater traction\nwhen accompanied by a male colleague.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a scientist and a woman can also be mentally\nexhausting. \u2018Always thinking in systems, and about how everything will affect\nothers, can be extremely draining because I am always trying to find links,\nconnections and possible outcomes or consequences in everything I do,\u2019 she\nsaid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwacela, who is cognisant of the need to be an example\nto young women in science, is undertaking PhD research on community food\nsystems and their relation to and impact on household food security. She works\nclosely with communities in Swayimane, Msinga, Mbumbulu, Nhlazuka and Tugela\nFerry. She also hopes to work with the St Wendolins community where she was\nborn and raised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018Each community has its distinct systems and means of\nproduction, purchasing and food consumption patterns,\u2019 she explained. \u2018Through\nthis research, I hope to develop an electronic tool to aid households in making\nhealthier food choices and increase culinary skills specifically related to the\nfood system and environment around them.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwacela hopes that the hallmarks of her career will be\nthe passion she has for people, and for the communities with whom she has\nworked since she entered this field. She also hopes that her research will have\na positive impact on people\u2019s lives, even if it is simply to broaden their\nthinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her achievements have been many, but among the most\nimportant for her was having her late grandmother, Ms Juliana Gwacela, attend\ntwo of her graduation ceremonies and hearing her ululating in the audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018She was my best cheerleader and supporter in all I\ndid,\u2019 said Gwacela.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable accomplishments are achieving her\nmaster\u2019s degree, serving as a panellist for the Academy of Science of South\nAfrica, and contributing to a Food Security and Policy Workshop for the SADC\nregion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwacela encouraged other young female scientists to\nlook for problems that only they understand, and to seize the opportunity to\nsolve problems that the world has been waiting for solutions to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of our Wonder Women in Science could easily be\nundercover superheroes, so here is some inside info on the kind of superhero\nwe\u2019ve found in Gwacela:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q.
