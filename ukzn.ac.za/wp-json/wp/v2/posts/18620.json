They were introduced to the HSRC\u2019s research and were accompanied by the CCBR\u2019s community team to visit several projects currently underway in the community surrounding the site. This was a good introduction to conducting applied social science research.<\/p>\n<p>Said van der Riet, \u2018The visit developed out of the strong relationship between the\u00a0Discipline of Psychology (School of Applied Human Sciences) in Pietermaritzburg and the HSRC.\u00a0Many UKZN alumni have been employed as researchers and even executive members of the HSRC.\u00a0The Masters Social Science in Research Psychology programme aims to develop professional researchers with a broad range of skills who can design, co-ordinate and manage programmes and interventions. Seeing how the HSRC conducts social and health-related research, exposes students to social science research in action, and develops their professional identity and aspirations.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Hardwick said he \u2018enjoyed getting to see what a research site looks like first hand, as well as interacting with the people who work there who were all really warm and welcoming.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>For Chetty, \u2018the opportunity to observe research projects being carried out on a much larger scale was interesting. It was interesting to learn about the different environments in which\u00a0research work is carried out. It\u2019s not an office and a laptop, but involves being physically active and building relationships with different individuals.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Tselana added that,\u00a0\u2018learning about the different aspects of research, especially on a larger scale was an eye-opener. I found the various ongoing projects conducted by the HSRC interesting. The lengths the researchers go to collect data and maintain relationships with participants were insightful. I gained more knowledge about the HSRC and the daily life of a researcher which I found helpful as I am nearing the end of the coursework part of my master\u2019s.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Words:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:mungroo@ukzn.ac.za\">Melissa Mungroo<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Photograph: Supplied<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Six Masters in Social Science Research Psychology students and their lecturer Professor Mary van der Riet visited the Human Sciences Research Council\u2019s (HSRC) Centre for Community Based Research (CCBR) in Sweetwaters outside Pietermaritzburg.
