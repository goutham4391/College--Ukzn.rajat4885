The primary objective centres on the maintenance of academic proficiency. The programme desires to foster academic excellence amongst all first year students. The programme strives to create an environment which is conducive for meaningful and effective learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Goals and Objectives:<\/strong><br \/>\nIt is the ambition and drive of the Student Mentorship Programme to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entrench an environment where excellence underlines the endeavours of the programme.<\/li>\n<li>Assist all students irrespective of race, gender and socio-economic status with regard to academic performance.<\/li>\n<li>Focus programme resources on student development; this includes the induction and socialisation of students.<\/li>\n<li>Constantly re-engineer and redefine the organisations focus by means of continuous research. In this manner, the Programme hopes to identify niche areas which can be exploited by the University for the benefit of learning enhancement.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that the University expands the capacity for retaining the majority of first-entry students through continuous and rigorous research.<\/li>\n<li>Optimise the induction process through mentoring, a process which all students must undergo. The value of informal academic assistance has been professed by many, and mentoring is the essence of this. Mentoring will allow the University to track and understand the performance of every individual student.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Mentors<\/strong><br \/>\nMentors are senior students who are academically competent and socially adept in guiding students in their first year at University. Mentors undergo a stringent selection procedure. The primary criteria for being selected are an excellent academic record and outstanding communication and leadership abilities.
